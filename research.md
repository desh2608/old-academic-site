### Deep learning applied to NLP and Vision

#### 1. Relation classification for biomedical text
*Bachelor Thesis Project under Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Devised and implemented a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model to learn long and short term dependencies
* Evaluated an attentive pooling strategy in comparison with conventional pooling methods
* Achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (i2b2 and DDI) without any need for manual feature engineering

#### 2. Identifying semantically equivalent questions
*Guide: Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Working on a novel technique to identify duplicate questions using a joint representation and a template-based approach
* Comparing with baselines involving feature-based classifiers, kernel-based pair-wise ranking, soft cosine similarity, and adversarial training
* Evaluation on the Quora dataset and a StackOverflow dataset

#### 3. Text readability analysis using language modeling
*Guide: Prof. Ashish Anand, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Developed an unsupervised approach for predicting text readability scores using different language models
* Implemented statistical and deep-learning models, for comparing results with vocabulary-based and syntactic approaches

#### 4. Spatial transformer networks
*Guide: Prof. Arijit Sur, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* Used the STN module from [Jaderberg et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5854-spatial-transformer-networks.pdf) (NIPS 2015) for object recognition and activity prediction from egocentric images
* Worked with GTEA and Intel Egocentric Vision data sets on Tensorflow

### Artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and fuzzy theory

#### 1. Monitoring production line performance to reduce failures
*Guide: Prof. Rashmi Dutta Baruah, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati*

* The objective was to model fault recognition as a classification problem consisting of very high-dimensional data containing thousands of instances
* Worked on feature selection using Gradient Boosting, and representation of categorical features by a single numeric feature using STG and RDA methods
* Also proposed a meta-optimization of the evaluation metric using Bayesian optimization, as a post-classification step

#### 2. Similarity analysis on multidimensional fuzzy sets
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Analyzed various multidimensional fuzzy membership functions and compared similarity of data sets using Wilcoxons nonparametric tests
* Established guidelines for selecting appropriate MFs based on data set and application requirements
* Recently extended the proposed method for high-dimensional data using dimensionality reduction approaches like PCA, kernel PCA, probabilistic PCA, and t-SNE

#### 3. Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) clustering
*Guide: Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee, Dept. of ECE, Hanyang University, Korea*

* Worked on improving clustering performance of fuzzy ART algorithm by integrating Interval Type-2 approach into vigilance parameter computation
* Obtained 5-10% better classification results compared to other methods

#### 4. Survey on probabilistic databases
*Guide: Prof. Amit Awekar, Dept. of CSE, IIT Guwahati, India*

* Reviewed existing work on probabilistic DBs, categorized into 5 major sections, namely algebra, query evaluation, conditioning, scaling and implementation
* Through a reevaluation of performance parameters, we showed that query evaluation is indeed the
bottleneck in efficient development and implementation of the probabilistic DBMS model
