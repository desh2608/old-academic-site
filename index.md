I am a Computer Science graduate from IIT Guwahati (India). My research interest is in deep learning applied to Natural Language Processing. I have also worked with pattern recognition and fuzzy logic systems in the past.

I am particularly interested in the application of advanced deep learning methods to improve machine reading tasks, and eventually push the state-of-the-art in problems like machine translation, question-answering, and abstractive summarization.

I am looking for potential Ph.D. advisors, and would be willing to start as soon as possible. My CV can be downloaded [here](assets/DeshRaj.pdf)
